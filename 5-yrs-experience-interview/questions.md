Nice — this will likely be a **deep technical + architectural** discussion.
Since he's a **Principal Architect** with a strong enterprise background, expect him to go beyond coding and test your **design, scalability, and ownership** mindset.

Here's a categorized list of **realistic questions** he might ask you:

---

### ⚙️ **System Design & Architecture**

1. How would you design a scalable notification or chat system using Node.js and Postgres?
2. What factors do you consider before breaking a monolith into microservices?
3. How do you handle inter-service communication — REST vs. message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)?
4. How would you ensure data consistency between multiple microservices?
5. What caching strategy would you use in a high-read system (Redis, memory cache, etc.)?
6. Explain how you'd design a rate limiter or job scheduling system in Node.js.
7. How would you scale Postgres horizontally for millions of users?

---

### 🧠 **Backend & Node.js Deep Dive**

1. Explain Node.js event loop phases and how async/await works internally.
2. How do you manage long-running or CPU-intensive tasks in Node.js?
3. What's the difference between clustering and worker threads in Node.js?
4. How would you structure a large-scale Node.js codebase for maintainability?
5. How do you handle error retries for async operations (like DB + file ops)?
6. How do you monitor performance and memory usage in Node.js apps?

---

### 🗄️ **PostgreSQL & Data Layer**

1. Explain indexing strategies — B-Tree, GIN, and GiST — and when to use them.
2. How would you handle large tables with millions of rows (partitioning, indexing)?
3. How do transactions and isolation levels work in Postgres?
4. How would you design schema for time-series or audit logs?
5. What's your approach to database migrations and rollback strategies?

---

### ☁️ **Scalability, Reliability, and Infra**

1. How would you deploy and scale your app on Kubernetes or Docker?
2. How do you handle logging, monitoring, and alerting (ELK, Prometheus, etc.)?
3. How do you ensure zero-downtime deployment?
4. What's your strategy for handling API versioning and backward compatibility?

---

### 👥 **Leadership & Mindset**

1. What's the most challenging backend issue you've solved recently?
2. How do you handle disagreements with architects or team leads?
3. How do you ensure your code and design decisions are scalable long term?
